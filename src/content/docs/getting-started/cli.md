`bithuman` is a single binary that runs the whole avatar stack from
one command. Browser-served live chat, offline MP4 render, model
introspection, host check. Same surface on macOS arm64 and Linux
(x86_64 + aarch64).

## Install

The bithuman CLI ships as its own package — `bithuman-cli` on the
Homebrew tap *and* on PyPI. **The exact same Rust binary is shipped
through all three install channels (Homebrew, universal `curl|sh`, PyPI
wheel) — byte-identical.** Pick whichever fits your environment.

(The `bithuman` PyPI package is the **Python SDK / library** — `from
bithuman import AsyncBithuman` — and does not ship the CLI as of 2.3.)

```bash
# macOS Homebrew — recommended on Apple Silicon.
brew install bithuman-cli

# Universal installer — macOS + Linux, no Python required.
curl -fsSL https://github.com/bithuman-product/homebrew-bithuman/releases/latest/download/install.sh | sh

# PyPI sibling wheel — same Rust binary, Python-friendly install.
pip install bithuman-cli
```

The `pip install bithuman-cli` path supports Python 3.10–3.14 on macOS
arm64 + Linux x86_64 / aarch64. CLI source lives in `bithuman-apps`
*(private — collaborator-only)*; end users install via the published
artifacts above. Verify the install:

```bash
$ bithuman --version
libessence 1.19.1 ABI 7
bithuman    2.3.0

$ bithuman doctor      # full host + key + cache check
```

## Two ways to talk to the avatar

| Brain | Requires | Use when |
|---|---|---|
| **Cloud** (OpenAI Realtime) | `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Fast warm-up, lowest first-token latency, hosted reliability |
| **On-device** (whisper.cpp + llama.cpp + Supertonic) | `pip install 'bithuman-cli[local]'` + `BITHUMAN_LOCAL=1` | Zero outbound network, private audio, kiosks / offline / mobile-ramp |

Both go through the **same** `bithuman run` command:

```bash
export BITHUMAN_API_SECRET=...     # avatar-runtime auth (both modes)
                                   # (BITHUMAN_API_KEY is accepted as an alias)

# Cloud:
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
bithuman run avatar.imx

# On-device:
pip install 'bithuman-cli[local]'
BITHUMAN_LOCAL=1 bithuman run avatar.imx
```

Both print a `http://127.0.0.1:8088/<CODE>` URL — open it, grant mic
permission, talk. See [Local mode →](/guides/local-mode) for the
on-device stack details.

## Subcommands

The bithuman CLI exposes exactly six subcommands. There are no
hidden commands; older 1.x verbs (`voice`, `text`, `avatar`, `stream`,
`speak`, `action`, `generate`, `asr`, `tts`, `models pull`,
`models list`, `cleanup`) have been removed in 2.x.

```text
bithuman run    avatar.imx                    live browser-served avatar
bithuman render avatar.imx -a a.wav -o m.mp4  offline render: model + WAV → MP4
bithuman info   avatar.imx                    print .imx metadata
bithuman list                                 browse showcase avatars
bithuman pull   <slug>                        download a showcase avatar
bithuman doctor                               host + auth + cache sanity check
bithuman --version                            libessence + ABI + CLI versions
```

All accept `--help` for the full flag listing.

### `bithuman run` — live avatar (cloud OR on-device)

The headline command. Stands up an embedded `livekit-server`, a
`libessence` runtime, the conversation brain (cloud OpenAI Realtime
or on-device whisper/llama/Supertonic per `BITHUMAN_LOCAL`), and a
browser landing page — all from one invocation.

```bash
bithuman run ~/.cache/bithuman/showcase/modern-court-jester.imx
```

Common flags:

| Flag | Default | What |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--host` | `127.0.0.1` | Bind address. Pass a Tailnet / LAN IP to expose. `0.0.0.0` needs `--allow-public-bind`. |
| `--port` | `8088` | Launcher HTTP port. |
| `--max-sessions` | (CPU count) | Pool cap; new launches are rejected (not degraded) when full. |
| `--embedded-livekit` | on with model arg | Spawn a self-contained `livekit-server` child. Off when omitting model + using external SFU. |
| `--mock-runtime` | off | Run with black frames instead of libessence — for protocol tests. |

### `bithuman render` — offline MP4

For batch jobs or pipelines with TTS upstream:

```bash
bithuman render avatar.imx --audio speech.wav --output demo.mp4
```

Flags:

| Flag | Default | What |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `-a`, `--audio <PATH>` | (required) | 16 kHz mono PCM WAV input. |
| `-o`, `--output <PATH>` | `output.mp4` | Output MP4 path. |
| `--quality <PRESET>` | `MEDIUM` | Encoder preset: `LOW`, `MEDIUM`, `HIGH`. |
| `--target-size <SIZE>` | `1280` | Either a single number `N` (longest side binds to `N`, aspect preserved) or `WxH` (explicit canvas). |
| `--limit <N>` | none | Cap output frame count — for testing. |


**macOS limitation.** The encoder behind `bithuman render` is currently
**Linux-only** — on macOS the command will print a `not implemented:
be_video_encoder_*` error and exit. Three workarounds:

1. **Run inside a Linux Docker container.** From an `python:3.12-slim`
   (or similar) container, `pip install bithuman-cli` and run the
   render there — mount your `.imx` and WAV in and the MP4 out.
2. **Use `bithuman run` instead.** The live-avatar path doesn't need
   the offline encoder — it publishes frames into LiveKit via the
   webrtc-rs encoder. You can record from the browser if you need a
   file.
3. **Render on a Linux host.** A small Linux box or CI runner with
   `bithuman-cli` installed will render any `.imx` + WAV pair to MP4
   identically.

An AVFoundation-based native macOS encoder is on the roadmap; until it
ships, treat `bithuman render` on macOS as a "not supported yet" path.


### `bithuman doctor` — install sanity check

When something doesn't work, run this first. It checks:

- **Versions** — libessence engine + ABI tag + CLI binary version.
- **Host** — OS, arch, total RAM, with a "is this big enough for local mode" hint.
- **Auth + brain selection** — `BITHUMAN_API_SECRET` (avatar auth) and which brain is selected (cloud OpenAI, on-device, or neither).
- **Brain availability** — for cloud, whether `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set; for local, whether the `[local]` extra is installed and weights are downloadable.
- **Caches** — sizes of `~/.cache/bithuman` (avatars + showcase), the brain venv, `~/.cache/huggingface` + `~/.cache/supertonic` (local-mode model downloads).

Exits 0 only if **both** avatar auth and a brain path are configured.
CI-friendly:

```bash
bithuman doctor && bithuman run avatar.imx
```

### `bithuman list` + `pull`

Browse the showcase fixture manifest, download one:

```bash
bithuman list
bithuman pull modern-court-jester
bithuman run ~/.cache/bithuman/showcase/modern-court-jester.imx
```

### `bithuman info`

Print `.imx` metadata (model type, fixture name, frame size, sample rate,
duration, hash). Handy for verifying a model file before deploy:

```bash
bithuman info avatar.imx
```

## Cache layout

| Path | Contents |
|---|---|
| `~/.cache/bithuman/models` | `.imx` avatar models (pool mode default `--models-root`) |
| `~/.cache/bithuman/avatars` | Imported avatars staged via `POST /launch` |
| `~/.cache/bithuman/showcase` | Downloads from `bithuman pull` |
| `~/.cache/bithuman/brain-venv` | Auto-bootstrapped venv for the bundled conversation brain (only used when not pip-installed) |
| `~/.cache/huggingface/hub` | Local-mode STT + LLM weights (whisper.cpp `.bin`, llama.cpp `.gguf`) |
| `~/.cache/supertonic` | Local-mode TTS ONNX weights |

`bithuman doctor` shows current sizes per dir. Clear the whole tree
with `rm -rf ~/.cache/bithuman` (regenerates on next run).

## Environment

| Var | What |
| --- | --- |
| `BITHUMAN_API_SECRET` | Avatar-runtime auth (metering). Canonical name on the CLI. `BITHUMAN_API_KEY` is accepted as an alias for cross-SDK parity. Get a free key at [bithuman.ai → Developer](https://www.bithuman.ai/#developer). |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Cloud conversation brain (OpenAI Realtime). Required for `bithuman run` unless `BITHUMAN_LOCAL=1` is set. |
| `BITHUMAN_LOCAL` | `=1` flips the brain to the on-device stack (whisper.cpp + llama.cpp + Supertonic + Silero). Needs the `[local]` extra: `pip install 'bithuman-cli[local]'`. See [Local mode →](/guides/local-mode). |
| `BITHUMAN_LOCAL_*` | Per-component tuning (whisper model, LLM, voice, language). [Reference](/guides/local-mode#tuning). |
| `BITHUMAN_INSTRUCTIONS` | System prompt override for the brain. |
| `BITHUMAN_UNMETERED` | `=1` skips the avatar-runtime auth heartbeat — dev / parity testing only. |
| `RUST_LOG` | Tracing filter. Default `info,bithuman_serve=info`. |
