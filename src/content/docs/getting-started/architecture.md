bitHuman is shipped as a single cross-platform runtime with idiomatic SDKs in each language. This page documents how the pieces fit together — useful if you're choosing which surface to integrate, or just curious about what runs where.

## Pick by what you're building

| Goal | Install | What you get |
|---|---|---|
| Embed in a Python app | `pip install bithuman` | Python SDK (library only, ~5 MB) |
| Embed in a Swift app | SwiftPM `bitHumanKit` | Swift SDK + bundled libessence XCFramework |
| Embed in an Android app | `ai.bithuman:sdk` (Maven Central) | Kotlin SDK + AAR (`arm64-v8a`) |
| Run from CLI on Mac | `brew install bithuman-cli` | bithuman CLI (single Rust binary) |
| Run from CLI on Linux | `curl -fsSL https://github.com/bithuman-product/homebrew-bithuman/releases/latest/download/install.sh \| sh` | bithuman CLI (single Rust binary) |
| Run from CLI in any Python env | `pip install bithuman-cli` | Same Rust binary, ships inside a Python wheel |
| On-device brain for CLI | `pip install 'bithuman-cli[local]'` | CLI + on-device STT / LLM / TTS |

All SDKs and the CLI read the same `.imx` model file and produce byte-equivalent frames. Third-party dependencies are bundled inside each distribution — your app's `Package.swift` / `build.gradle.kts` / `requirements.txt` only needs the bithuman dependency, never a transitive `onnxruntime` / `webp` / `livekit-server`.

## How the pieces fit together

The bithuman platform is three owned layers (engine, SDKs, apps) plus an
upstream integration layer (L4) that wires bithuman into other
ecosystems.

```

Most developers integrate at the SDK layer (L2) — you never need to know
what's underneath. The engine is statically linked into each SDK
distribution, so there are no extra system libraries to install. The
bithuman CLI (L3) consumes the Rust SDK the same way any third-party app
would.

## Cross-layer contracts

The three owned layers (engine, SDKs, apps) ship independently but agree on a small set of stable contracts. Everything else is internal and may change between releases.

- **Engine ABI (versioned).** The bitHuman Engine (`libessence`) exposes a C ABI tagged with an explicit version. The current shipping ABI is **v7**, introduced in libessence 2.3.0 alongside the 2.3 SDK wave. Every language SDK declares the engine ABI it was built against; see the [Compatibility matrix](/getting-started/compatibility) for the current mapping. New ABI versions are additive — old SDK builds keep working with newer engines until a version is formally retired. `bithuman --version` prints `libessence <ver> ABI <n> / bithuman <ver>` so you can confirm at a glance.
- **SDK public API (stable across patch + minor).** The public surface in each language — `from bithuman import AsyncBithuman` (Python), `import bitHumanKit` (Swift), `import ai.bithuman.sdk.*` (Kotlin), `bithuman_core` (Rust) — is SemVer-stable. Patch releases never break source compatibility; minor releases add APIs without removing the old ones; major releases call out breaks explicitly in the [changelog](/changelog).
- **App distribution (channels are byte-equivalent).** The bithuman CLI in `bithuman-apps` consumes the SDKs as an ordinary third-party app. The exact same compiled Rust binary is shipped through Homebrew (`brew install bithuman-cli`), the universal `curl | sh` installer, and the PyPI wheel (`pip install bithuman-cli`) — byte-identical across all three channels.
- **One `.imx`, every surface.** A model file packed for one SDK runs identically across all of them. Parity is enforced by an in-tree contract test suite (`parity/`) that streams the same audio through every SDK and asserts byte-equal frames.

## Models

Two models, both supported across every SDK:

- **Essence** — a pre-built avatar identity packaged in an `.imx` file. Low memory, runs on every supported platform. The default choice.
- **Expression** — a dynamic avatar that animates *any* portrait image at runtime. Higher quality close-ups; needs more compute (Apple Silicon M3+ or NVIDIA GPU).

The same SDK methods drive both — see [Models](/getting-started/models) for the full comparison.

## Source layout — four repos

The layers map to four GitHub repos. Two are public (this docs source + the Homebrew tap), two are private (engine + SDKs in one monorepo, apps in another).

| Repo | Contents | Visibility |
|---|---|---|
| [`bithuman-sdk`](https://github.com/bithuman-product/bithuman-sdk) | bitHuman Engine (`engine/` — libessence) + L2 SDKs (`sdks/{python,swift,kotlin,rust}/`) + parity contract tests | Private (proprietary) |
| `bithuman-apps` | bithuman CLI + Flutter plugin + Expression demos + reference apps | Private (proprietary) |
| [`bithuman-sdk-public`](https://github.com/bithuman-product/bithuman-sdk-public) | docs.bithuman.ai source + runnable Examples + landing pages | Public, MIT |
| [`homebrew-bithuman`](https://github.com/bithuman-product/homebrew-bithuman) | Homebrew tap formula + universal curl-pipe installer + release artifacts | Public, Apache-2.0 |

Two more pieces sit *outside* this four-repo split: the cloud runtime
(`api.bithuman.ai`) serves model downloads + the billing heartbeat, and
the model weights (`.imx` files) themselves are private and gated by API
key at download time. The IP that matters — weights, the cloud GPU
service, billing — is server-side. The engine + SDKs compile into the
public binary distributions; the apps consume them the same way any
third-party would.

## Release flow

Every release starts from a single coordinated git tag on the engine repo (`bithuman-sdk`) and fans out across the SDK repo and the apps repo:

```
Coordinated release tag (engine + SDKs)
    │
    ├──► PyPI               bithuman 2.3.0          (Python SDK / library)
    ├──► PyPI               bithuman-cli 2.3.0      (CLI, from bithuman-apps)
    ├──► Maven Central      ai.bithuman:sdk:1.17.1  (Kotlin SDK — separate cadence)
    ├──► GitHub Releases    Swift XCFramework + Rust CLI tarballs
    ├──► Homebrew tap       bithuman-cli 2.3.0 formula (from bithuman-apps)
    └──► pub.dev            Flutter plugin 1.16.0   (separate cadence; publish queued)

The Kotlin SDK, Flutter plugin, and Rust SDK each have their own
release cadence — see the [Compatibility matrix](/getting-started/compatibility)
for the current state of each artifact.

## Model weights

Avatar `.imx` files are downloaded from authenticated endpoints on first use and cached locally:

| Surface | Cache location |
|---|---|
| Python / Swift / Kotlin (Essence) | `~/.cache/bithuman/models/` |
| Swift (Expression on Mac/iPad) | `~/.cache/bithuman/expression/` |
| bitHuman CLI (`--local` mode) | Same as above plus LLM/TTS weights |

Downloads are integrity-verified and cached. Subsequent launches are instant.

## Authentication and billing

One credential drives every surface. Platform convention determines the variable name:

```
BITHUMAN_API_SECRET    # Python, Kotlin, REST API, CLI
BITHUMAN_API_KEY       # Swift (Apple convention)
```

The SDK never holds the long-lived secret in process memory — it exchanges the secret for a short-lived runtime token at startup, auto-renewing on the billing heartbeat. Failed heartbeats trigger a 5-minute offline grace window before the avatar pauses.

Full flow and per-SDK setup: [Authentication](/getting-started/authentication). Pricing: [Pricing](/getting-started/pricing).

## Design principles

A few choices shaped this architecture:

- **One runtime, every platform.** The same source produces every binary distribution. Output is identical across targets.
- **Zero transitive dependencies for SDK consumers.** Your app's manifest needs only the bithuman dependency — everything else is bundled in.
- **Same credential everywhere.** `BITHUMAN_API_KEY` and `BITHUMAN_API_SECRET` are the same value; only the env-var name differs by platform convention.
- **Audio-only mode is unmetered.** Without an attached avatar the runtime is fully offline and bills nothing — encourages experimentation.
- **Model weights stay cloud-gated.** The runtime is portable; the weights are the IP.

## Canonical install commands

The full per-language matrix lives in [Quickstart](/getting-started/quickstart);
this table is the one-liner reference for each surface.

| Surface | Install |
|---|---|
| bitHuman Python SDK | `pip install bithuman` |
| bitHuman Swift SDK | SwiftPM `bitHumanKit` (binary XCFramework) |
| bitHuman Kotlin SDK | Maven Central `ai.bithuman:sdk` |
| bitHuman Rust SDK | In-tree `bithuman-core` crate (not on crates.io yet) |
| bithuman CLI — Homebrew (Mac) | `brew install bithuman-cli` |
| bithuman CLI — universal (Mac + Linux) | `curl -fsSL https://github.com/bithuman-product/homebrew-bithuman/releases/latest/download/install.sh \| sh` |
| bithuman CLI — Python wheel | `pip install bithuman-cli` (add `[local]` for on-device brain) |
| LiveKit plugin | `pip install livekit-plugins-bithuman` |
