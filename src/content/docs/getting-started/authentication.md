**You only need an API key when an avatar is rendering.** Audio-only voice agents (Swift `VoiceChat` with no `config.avatar`) run fully offline without one. If that's your path, skip this page.


bitHuman uses a single shared credential per account that authenticates every SDK and the REST API. There are two equivalent ways to refer to it depending on which SDK you're using:

- **`BITHUMAN_API_SECRET`** — used by the Python SDK, REST API, LiveKit plugin, Kotlin SDK, and CLI.
- **`BITHUMAN_API_KEY`** — used by the Swift SDK on Apple platforms. Same value, different env var name to match Apple convention.

The credential never sits in process memory. On runtime startup the SDK exchanges it for a short-lived runtime token that auto-renews on a one-request-per-minute billing heartbeat.

## 1. Get a key


  
    Sign in at [bithuman.ai](https://www.bithuman.ai) (free tier — no credit card).
  
  
    Go to [https://www.bithuman.ai/#developer](https://www.bithuman.ai/#developer).
  
  
    Click **Create new key**, name it (e.g. "production-mac"), and copy the value. **You won't be able to view it again** — store it somewhere durable.
  
  
    With the CLI installed (`brew install bithuman-product/bithuman/bithuman-cli`):

    ```bash
    export BITHUMAN_API_SECRET="your_key"
    bithuman doctor
    ```

    `bithuman doctor` checks the credential, brain selection
    (`OPENAI_API_KEY` or `BITHUMAN_LOCAL=1`), cache sizes, and host
    capabilities — exits 0 if your install can stand up a live avatar.

    Or hit the REST endpoint directly:

    ```bash
    curl -X POST https://api.bithuman.ai/v1/validate \
      -H "api-secret: YOUR_KEY"
    ```

    A 200 with `{"valid": true, ...}` means you're good.
  


## 2. Set it for your SDK

### Python SDK

```bash
export BITHUMAN_API_SECRET="your_key"
```

Or pass via the `api_secret` parameter:

```python
runtime = await AsyncBithuman.create(
    model_path="avatar.imx",
    api_secret="your_key",
)
```

### LiveKit Plugin (`livekit-plugins-bithuman`)

Same env var as the Python SDK:

```bash
export BITHUMAN_API_SECRET="your_key"
```

### REST API

Pass the `api-secret` header on every request:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.bithuman.ai/v1/agent/A78WKV4515/speak \
  -H "api-secret: $BITHUMAN_API_SECRET" \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "Hello"}'
```

### Swift SDK (`bitHumanKit`)

Either env var or config:

```swift
// Option 1: env var (recommended for development)
config.apiKey = ProcessInfo.processInfo.environment["BITHUMAN_API_KEY"]

// Option 2: explicit (for production where you fetch from Keychain)
config.apiKey = await fetchFromBackend()
```

For Xcode development, set `BITHUMAN_API_KEY` via **Product → Scheme → Edit Scheme → Run → Arguments → Environment Variables**. **Never hardcode the key in source.**

For production:
- **DMG distribution** — bundle the key into your `.app`'s Info.plist via a build script that runs `sed` on a placeholder. Source stays clean; only the compiled artifact has the key. See the Mac reference app's `build-mac-app.sh` for the canonical pattern.
- **App Store** — fetch from your own backend via Keychain on first launch. Don't bundle.

### CLI

```bash
brew install bithuman-product/bithuman/bithuman-cli
export BITHUMAN_API_SECRET="your_api_secret"
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."          # cloud brain (or use BITHUMAN_LOCAL=1)
bithuman pull modern-court-jester
bithuman run ~/.cache/bithuman/showcase/modern-court-jester.imx
# → browser-served avatar at http://127.0.0.1:8088/<CODE>
```

## 3. Audio-only Swift mode is unmetered

If you only want on-device voice chat (no lip-synced avatar), **skip the API key entirely**:

```swift
var config = VoiceChatConfig()
config.systemPrompt = "You are a helpful assistant."
config.voice = .preset("Aiden")
// no config.avatar = ...

let chat = VoiceChat(config: config)
try await chat.start()  // does not authenticate
```

This mode runs fully offline (after first-launch weight downloads), bills nothing, and doesn't require a key. See [pricing](/getting-started/pricing) for what's free vs metered.

## How the auth flow works

1. Your code provides the API secret to the SDK / REST request.
2. The SDK exchanges it for a short-lived **runtime token** at `https://api.bithuman.ai/v1/runtime-tokens/request`.
3. That token authenticates the actual avatar engine (heartbeat + frame production).
4. Tokens auto-renew every minute via the heartbeat.
5. Bad keys fail at step 2 — fast — before any user-visible work.

The `BITHUMAN_API_SECRET` itself is never sent to the avatar process or any third party. It only ever travels to `api.bithuman.ai` over TLS to mint tokens.

## Common errors

| Error | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `Authentication failed` (Python) | Wrong / missing `BITHUMAN_API_SECRET` | Verify with the `curl /v1/validate` recipe above. |
| `VoiceChatError.missingAPIKey` (Swift) | Avatar mode without `apiKey` set | Set `config.apiKey` or export `BITHUMAN_API_KEY`. |
| `VoiceChatError.authenticationFailed` (Swift) | Avatar mode with bad key | Confirm the key is valid; check it hasn't been rotated. |
| 401 from REST API | Missing `api-secret` header | Add header on every request. |
| Heartbeat goes silent after 5 minutes | Network dropped on-device | Reconnect; the SDK pauses the avatar after the 5-min grace window and resumes when heartbeats succeed. |

## Rotating keys

Keys can be rotated from the [Developer dashboard](https://www.bithuman.ai/#developer). Rotation invalidates the old key immediately. Live sessions using the old key will fail their next heartbeat (within ~60 s) and pause; restart with the new key to resume. There's no overlap window — rotate during a maintenance window if you have running production sessions.
