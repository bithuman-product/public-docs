bitHuman ships two avatar models. Both share the same `.imx` file
format and the same SDK methods. **Essence is the default** — it runs
on virtually every CPU and is what `bithuman pull` ships in the
showcase. **Expression** is the heavier high-fidelity option for
specific on-device Apple Silicon or GPU server use cases.

## At a glance

| | **Essence** (default) | **Expression** |
|---|---|---|
| **What it does** | Pre-built avatar identity packaged in an `.imx` file. Real-time lip-sync. | Dynamic facial animation from any portrait image at runtime. |
| **Avatar source** | `.imx` you build once from a photo or video. | Any face image — provide at runtime, no build step. |
| **Custom gestures** | Yes (wave, nod, laugh, etc.) | No |
| **Idle animation** | Pre-recorded natural movement | AI-generated micro-movements |
| **Compute needed** | Any modern CPU | Apple Silicon M3+ (demo apps) or NVIDIA GPU |
| **Memory footprint** | Low (~200–500 MB) | Higher (~2–6 GB) |
| **Best for** | Kiosks, mobile, edge, 24/7 deployments, high concurrency | Close-up native consumer apps, custom faces per session |
| **Pricing** | 1 credit/min self-hosted · 2 credits/min cloud | 2 credits/min self-hosted · 4 credits/min cloud |

Both ship to every surface — SDKs, REST API, LiveKit plugin, CLI, on-device, embed widget. The same `.imx` file works everywhere.

## Where each model runs

| Surface | Essence | Expression |
|---|---|---|
| **iOS / iPadOS** | ✅ iPhone 17 Pro+, iPad Pro M4+ | ✅ iPad Pro M4+ only |
| **macOS arm64** | ✅ Any Apple Silicon | ✅ M3+ |
| **macOS Intel** | ⚠️ Pending (2.3 ships arm64 only) | — |
| **Android** | ✅ `arm64-v8a`, Android 10+ | — |
| **Linux x86_64 / aarch64** | ✅ Any modern CPU | ✅ via NVIDIA GPU (Docker) |
| **Windows** | ⚠️ Pending (use WSL2 today) | — |
| **Raspberry Pi 4B+** | ✅ | — |
| **bitHuman Cloud** | ✅ Managed | ✅ Managed |
| **Self-hosted CPU** | ✅ Python SDK / LiveKit plugin | — |
| **Self-hosted GPU** | — | ✅ Docker container |

Native macOS-Intel and Windows wheels are pending for the 2.3 line;
the [device matrix](/getting-started/device-matrix) tracks per-platform
shipping status. iPhone Expression is not currently supported — use
Essence on iPhone.

## Essence

Essence packages a complete avatar identity (face, body, gestures) into an `.imx` file. At runtime, the SDK plays back pre-rendered base motion and patches the mouth region in real time to match incoming audio.

**Runtime characteristics**

- ~200–500 MB resident, 1–2 CPU cores, real-time at 25 FPS.
- Runs on macOS arm64, Linux x86_64 / aarch64, iOS, iPadOS, Android, Raspberry Pi 4B+.
- No idle timeout — sessions can run 24/7. Reliable for unattended kiosks and lobby displays.
- Supports custom gestures (wave, nod, laugh) triggered by keywords or API.
- Predictable, consistent behavior. Lower per-stream cost — the right pick for high-concurrency self-hosted deployments.

**Try it from the showcase**

The CLI ships a curated set of ready-to-run Essence `.imx` avatars:

```bash
bithuman list                          # browse the showcase
bithuman pull modern-court-jester      # downloads to ~/.cache/bithuman/showcase/<slug>.imx
bithuman run modern-court-jester.imx   # live browser-served avatar
```

**How to ship it**

- [**Python SDK**](/sdks/python) — self-host on macOS arm64 + Linux x86_64 / aarch64.
- [**Swift SDK**](/sdks/swift) — native Mac, iPad, iPhone apps.
- [**Kotlin SDK**](/sdks/kotlin) — native Android apps.
- [**Flutter plugin**](/integrations/flutter) — one Dart codebase across Mac, iOS, Android.
- [**bitHuman CLI**](/getting-started/cli) — no code, terminal or browser.
- [**REST API**](/api-reference/overview) — backend integration in any language.
- [**Cloud LiveKit plugin**](/guides/deployment) — managed, no infrastructure.
- [**Embed widget**](/guides/deployment) — drop-in iframe for websites.

## Expression

Expression generates real-time facial animation directly from a portrait image. The face can change between sessions or even mid-session — no avatar build step is required.

**Runtime characteristics**

- ~2–6 GB resident; needs Apple Silicon M3+ (Mac) / M4+ (iPad Pro) or an NVIDIA GPU (8 GB+ VRAM).
- Works with any face image — drag-and-drop swap, photo, video frame, anything.
- AI-driven expressions adapt to speech content and emotional context.
- Higher visual fidelity for close-up conversational interactions.
- On-device demo apps target macOS M3+ and iPad Pro M4+. iPhone Expression and macOS-Intel are not currently supported.

**How to ship it**

- [**Cloud LiveKit plugin**](/guides/deployment) — bitHuman hosts the GPU worker (set `model="expression"`).
- [**Self-hosted GPU**](/guides/deployment) — your own NVIDIA GPU via the Docker container.
- [**On-device macOS / iPadOS**](/sdks/swift) — Apple Silicon M3+, via the Swift SDK.
- [**macos-avatar example**](https://github.com/bithuman-product/bithuman-sdk-public/tree/main/Examples/swift/macos-avatar) — a complete native macOS Expression app.
- [**bitHuman CLI**](/getting-started/cli) — `bithuman run` with an Expression `.imx`.
- [**REST API**](/api-reference/overview) — same endpoint as Essence; the model is selected per agent.

## Which should I use?


  
    **Essence.** No idle timeout, runs on CPU, predictable for unattended deployments.
  
  
    **Essence** via the [Flutter plugin](/integrations/flutter). Same UI on Mac, iOS, Android.
  
  
    **Essence.** Expression on iPhone isn't currently supported — iPad and Mac are the on-device Expression hosts.
  
  
    **Essence** via the [Kotlin SDK](/sdks/kotlin) or [Flutter plugin](/integrations/flutter).
  
  
    **Expression on-device** via the [Swift SDK](/sdks/swift) or the Mac/iPad reference apps.
  
  
    **Essence.** Expression doesn't support gesture triggers.
  
  
    **Expression** via the Cloud Plugin. Pass the image at session start — no build step.
  
  
    **Essence.** Lower per-stream cost makes it the right pick for high-concurrency deployments.
  
  
    **Essence.** Runs on 1–2 CPU cores at 25 FPS.
  
  
    **Expression** with `quality="high"`. Best for offline batch jobs rather than real-time streaming.
