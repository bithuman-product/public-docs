bitHuman ships an engine (`libessence`) plus several language SDKs and a CLI tool. Each artifact declares a `libessence` ABI it builds against; this page maps the currently-shipping versions to engine ABIs so you can pin with confidence.

For the architectural background — what an ABI is, how the SDKs wrap it, why the apps live in a separate repo — see [Architecture](/getting-started/architecture).

## Current shipping versions

| Artifact | Latest version | Channel | libessence ABI |
|---|---|---|---|
| bitHuman Python SDK (`bithuman`) | **2.3.0** | [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/bithuman/) | v7 |
| bitHuman Swift SDK (`bitHumanKit`) | 0.8.2 | [SwiftPM via this repo](https://github.com/bithuman-product/bithuman-sdk-public) | v7 |
| bitHuman Kotlin SDK (`ai.bithuman:sdk`) | 1.17.1 | [Maven Central](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/ai.bithuman/sdk) | v6 |
| bitHuman Rust SDK (`bithuman-core`) | in-tree workspace crate | Source-only — not on crates.io yet | v7 |
| bithuman CLI (`bithuman`) | **2.3.0** | [Homebrew](https://github.com/bithuman-product/homebrew-bithuman) · [PyPI `bithuman-cli`](https://pypi.org/project/bithuman-cli/) · [universal installer](https://github.com/bithuman-product/homebrew-bithuman/releases/latest/download/install.sh) | v7 |
| Flutter plugin (`bithuman`) | 1.16.0 | git dep (pub.dev publish queued) | v6 |

Artifacts with **matching ABI** (the right-hand column) are interoperable, even if their headline versions differ — each SDK ships on its own release cadence but each declares the `libessence` ABI it links against. Mixing artifacts in one project — for example the Swift SDK on iOS + the Python `bithuman` 2.3.0 wheel on the backend — is supported and tested as long as the ABI columns line up.

A few honest caveats on the artifacts above:

- **Kotlin SDK** ships on its own cadence (currently 1.17.x on ABI v6).
  The 2.3.0 / v7 refresh is queued but not blocking — v6 callers
  continue to work against the v7 engine because v7 is additive.
- **Flutter plugin** is at 1.16.x on ABI v6 and is fetched as a git
  dependency today; the **pub.dev publish is queued** but has not
  shipped yet.
- **Rust SDK** (`bithuman-core`) exists as an in-tree workspace crate in
  the `bithuman-sdk` repo and powers the CLI, but it is **not yet
  published to crates.io**. External Rust consumers are not yet a
  supported channel.

## Engine ABI history

The engine ABI is the C surface `libessence` exposes to its language wrappers. New ABI versions are additive — old SDK builds that target an earlier ABI continue to work against newer engines until a version is formally retired.

| ABI | Introduced | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **v7** | libessence 2.3.0 | Adds `be_set_default_audio_encoder` for fallback audio-encoder registration. Backwards-compatible with v6 callers. |
| **v6** | libessence 1.16.0 | Streaming push-audio / pull-frame API (`be_runtime_push_audio`, `be_runtime_pull_frame`). Current production baseline; covers every shipping SDK above. |
| v5 and earlier | pre-1.16 | Retired in production builds — synchronous `be_runtime_tick_compose` only, no streaming. |

If you're vendoring `libessence` directly (rare — most users go through an SDK), confirm the ABI tag with `bithuman doctor` or, at the C layer, `be_runtime_abi_version()`.

## Combining SDKs in one project

All language SDKs that target the same `libessence` ABI are bit-equivalent at the frame level. Stream the same audio, get the same `.bgr_image` bytes back — verified by the in-tree `parity/` contract harness on every release.

This means a few practical things:

- One avatar fixture (`.imx`) drives every platform. Build it once, ship it to your Mac app, your Android app, and your backend service — no per-platform conversion.
- Reference frames captured in one SDK are valid test fixtures for every other SDK. The Python SDK is the easiest one to script test cases from.
- You can mix surfaces in one product without owning two avatar pipelines: a Python LiveKit agent on the server can render the same avatar that a Swift app renders on-device for offline turns.

## Platform support

For the 2.3.0 wave the published binary distributions cover:

| Platform | Python wheel (`bithuman` + `bithuman-cli`) | Homebrew / curl installer (CLI) | Swift SDK | Kotlin SDK |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| macOS arm64 (Apple Silicon, M-series) | Shipped | Shipped | Shipped | — |
| Linux x86_64 (`manylinux_2_28`) | Shipped | Shipped | — | — |
| Linux aarch64 (`manylinux_2_28`) | Shipped | Shipped | — | — |
| iOS (arm64) | — | — | Shipped (via XCFramework) | — |
| Android (`arm64-v8a`) | — | — | — | Shipped (AAR) |
| macOS Intel (x86_64) | **Not shipped** | **Not shipped** | — | — |
| Windows (x86_64) | **Not shipped** | **Not shipped** | — | — |

macOS-Intel and Windows are tracked but not part of the 2.3 cut. If
you're stuck on either, the 1.x line still has Windows wheels and a
macOS-Intel build — pin the whole stack there until those targets
graduate into the 2.x distribution.

## Skew policy

A few rules of thumb when versions don't line up cleanly:

- **Patch skew within a minor (`2.3.0` ↔ `2.3.1`) is always safe.** Patches never change the ABI or the public SDK API.
- **Minor skew (`2.2.x` ↔ `2.3.x`) is safe.** Minor releases only add APIs; existing code keeps compiling and running.
- **SDK / engine skew is safe across ABI versions that share a major.** A 1.17.1 Kotlin AAR (ABI v6) talks to a 2.3.0 engine because v7 is additive on v6 — you simply can't call the v7-only entry points from the older binding.
- **Major skew (`1.x` PyPI ↔ `2.x` PyPI on the Python side) is not supported.** The streaming API introduced in 2.0 reshaped the Python surface itself; pin the whole Python stack to one major.

If you need to stay on a 1.x Python SDK for a niche platform (Windows wheels, macOS-Intel) keep the Python side entirely on 1.x — the Swift / Kotlin / CLI artifacts can still be at their latest.
