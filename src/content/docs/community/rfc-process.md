title: RFC process
description: How we discuss + decide on platform-level changes.
---

The RFC ("request for comments") process is for changes that:

- Affect the public API of the engine, an SDK, or a published artifact
- Introduce a new public surface (subcommand, env var, file format)
- Change semantic versioning expectations
- Add a Layer 4 integration that consumes the SDK

Smaller changes (bug fixes, doc improvements, internal refactors) go
straight to a PR — no RFC needed.

## Template

Copy `templates/rfc-template.md` and fill in:

1. **Summary** — what is this and why now (1-2 sentences)
2. **Motivation** — concrete use case; existing pain
3. **Proposal** — API shape, file layout, command syntax (code examples preferred)
4. **Alternatives considered** — what else could work; why this is the choice
5. **Impact** — breaking changes, migration path, deprecations
6. **Open questions** — what's still uncertain

Open as a PR against `docs/rfcs/0NNN-short-name.mdx`. Discussion happens
in the PR comments; resolution happens when a maintainer merges it
(accepted) or closes it (declined or deferred).

Accepted RFCs are tracked at [/rfcs](/rfcs) and become the source of
truth for what's been committed to.

## Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

Smaller-scope decisions (which library to pick, naming choices, internal
patterns) go to `docs/decisions/000N-<topic>.md` as ADRs:

  - Title
  - Date
  - Status (proposed / accepted / superseded)
  - Context
  - Decision
  - Consequences

ADRs are committed alongside the change they describe.
