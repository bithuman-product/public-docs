A full voice-driven conversation: your mic feeds OpenAI Realtime, the AI's spoken reply drives a bitHuman avatar that lip-syncs in real time. Runs locally — no LiveKit server, no browser, no extra infrastructure.

## Quick start


  
    - **bitHuman** — [www.bithuman.ai](https://www.bithuman.ai)
    - **OpenAI** — [openai.com](https://openai.com)
  
  
    ```bash
    export BITHUMAN_API_SECRET="your_secret"
    export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_key"
    ```
  
  
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/bithuman-product/bithuman-sdk-public.git
    cd bithuman-sdk-public/Examples/python/local-essence
    python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt        # bithuman, openai, opencv, …
    ```
    Use a virtualenv — the example's `requirements.txt` pulls everything
    it needs (the SDK itself ships no OpenCV; the display window does).
  
  
    You need an avatar `.imx`. Easiest: run `bithuman pull modern-court-jester`
    once (caches to `~/.cache/bithuman/showcase/modern-court-jester.imx`), or
    download one from [Explore](https://www.bithuman.ai/#explore).

    ```bash
    python conversation.py --model ~/.cache/bithuman/showcase/modern-court-jester.imx
    ```
    Speak into your mic. The AI responds, the avatar lip-syncs in real time. Press `Q` to quit.

## What it does

1. Captures audio from your microphone via `sounddevice`.
2. Streams it to **OpenAI Realtime API** for AI conversation.
3. Pipes the AI's spoken reply into the bitHuman runtime.
4. Avatar lip-syncs and appears in an OpenCV window.

No LiveKit, no browser, no server-side WebRTC — everything runs on your machine.

## Customize the personality

```python
agent = Agent(
    instructions=(
        "You are a helpful customer-service assistant. "
        "Be friendly, professional, and solve problems quickly."
    )
)
```

Suggestions:

- **Tech support** — "You are a patient tech expert who explains things simply."
- **Sales** — "You are an enthusiastic product advisor."
- **Teacher** — "You are an encouraging tutor who makes learning fun."

## Common issues

| Problem | Fix |
|---|---|
| Script won't start | Check `BITHUMAN_API_SECRET` and `OPENAI_API_KEY` are both set in the same shell. |
| No mic input | Grant the terminal mic permission in System Settings → Privacy & Security → Microphone. |
| Avatar shows but doesn't lip-sync | Check the WAV / mic format — `conversation.py` expects 24 kHz PCM from OpenAI Realtime. |
| OpenAI rate limit | Your OpenAI account is throttled. Wait, retry, or upgrade your tier. |

## Want it in the browser?

For a full web-based setup with LiveKit + a browser UI, run the [Docker Compose stack](https://github.com/bithuman-product/bithuman-sdk-public/tree/main/Examples/python/cloud-essence) and open `http://localhost:4202`.

## Next steps


  
    Fully on-device voice agent — speech never leaves your Mac.
  
  
    Edge targets — Raspberry Pi, Android, low-power hosts.
