## Overview

The smallest copy-paste path to a working avatar over the REST API — no SDK, no language runtime, just `curl`. Use this when your stack isn't Python/Swift/Kotlin (backends, CI scripts, other languages).

## Prerequisites

- A bitHuman API secret — get one at [Developer → API Keys](https://www.bithuman.ai/#developer).

```bash
export BITHUMAN_API_SECRET=your_secret
```

> **Note** **Want to try for free first?** Generating an agent costs credits. To render an avatar at **$0 with no account**, use the SDK quickstart — it auto-downloads a sample model: see [Python — Hello, avatar](/examples/python-hello) or the [templates gallery](https://www.bithuman.ai/templates).

## 1. Validate your secret (free)

The cheapest call — verifies auth without spending credits:

```bash
curl -s -X POST https://api.bithuman.ai/v1/validate \
  -H "api-secret: $BITHUMAN_API_SECRET"
```

A `200` / `{"valid": true}` means you're good. Anything else is auth or networking — see the [API reference](/api/reference).

## 2. Generate an agent from a photo

Point the API at any public image URL of a face. This is asynchronous and costs credits.

```bash
curl -s -X POST https://api.bithuman.ai/v1/agent/generate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "api-secret: $BITHUMAN_API_SECRET" \
  -d '{
    "image_url": "https://example.com/face.jpg",
    "name": "My First Avatar"
  }'
```

The response includes an **agent code** (e.g. `A91XMB7113`). Save it:

```bash
export AGENT_ID=A91XMB7113
```

## 3. Poll until it's ready

```bash
curl -s "https://api.bithuman.ai/v1/agent/status/$AGENT_ID" \
  -H "api-secret: $BITHUMAN_API_SECRET"
```

Repeat until `state` is `ready` (typically a minute or two). On failure the generation credits are auto-refunded.

## 4. Talk to it

Once ready, open the agent in the web viewer and start a conversation at `https://agent.viewer.bithuman.ai/A91XMB7113`.

> **Warning** The `POST /v1/agent/{code}/speak` endpoint only works while the agent is in an **active session** (someone connected via the viewer, a LiveKit room, or the dashboard). With no active session you'll get `No active rooms found for agent`. To script speech, first join a session — see the [API reference](/api/reference).

## Full set of curl recipes

Every endpoint as a runnable script (validate, upload, generate, status, speak, add-context, list, credits):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bithuman-product/bithuman-sdk-public.git
cd bithuman-sdk-public/Examples/rest-api/curl
export BITHUMAN_API_SECRET=your_secret
./validate.sh
```

## Where to go next

- [API reference](/api/reference) — base URL, auth, agent codes, error format, and every operation including `/v1/agent/generate`.
- [API quickstart](/api/quickstart) — the guided path through your first API calls.
- [curl recipes](https://github.com/bithuman-product/bithuman-sdk-public/tree/main/Examples/rest-api/curl) — runnable scripts for every endpoint.
