title: Roadmap
description: What's shipping next, what's being explored, what's been done.
---

A snapshot of where the platform is going. Updated roughly monthly;
detailed items move to GitHub Issues when they're committed work.

## Shipped recently

- 2.3.0 — slim Python SDK + standalone `bithuman-cli` package
- Curl installer + Homebrew tap canonical name `bithuman-cli`
- 4-repo split (engine + apps + public docs + tap)
- Inline LiveKit bridge in `bithuman-cli` (works without upstream PR)
- Cross-binding parity harness for Python + Rust SDKs
- Layer 4 integration contract test (livekit-plugins-bithuman)
- [Browser-side avatar rendering](/guides/browser-rendering) — ONNX Runtime Web (WASM) renders the avatar in the user's tab; agent worker keeps the brain. Activate with `?rendering_mode=browser` on any agent landing page. Also `?rendering_mode=avatar` for a pure client-side mic-driven puppet (no LiveKit, no agent worker).

## In flight

| Item | Why | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Linux x86_64 + aarch64 CLI tarballs | Half the world's deploys | building |
| iOS xcframework slices | Swift SDK iOS use today is host-only | building |
| Showcase auto-pull on `bithuman run` | One-step from install to running | done — 2.3.x |
| `bithuman init` interactive wizard | First-run UX is multi-step | done — 2.3.x |
| Structured error codes (Python SDK) | Catch + retry by code, not string | done — 2.3.x |
| LiveKit upstream pin relaxation | Drop inline bridge once merged | PR open: livekit/agents#5882 |

## Exploring (no commitment yet)

- JS/TS SDK (browser + Node) — biggest top-of-funnel gap
- Web playground at try.bithuman.ai — no-install demo
- Windows CLI binary + Python wheel
- OpenTelemetry hooks + structured logging mode
- Plugin architecture for custom STT/TTS/LLM providers
- Maven 2.3.x / ABI v7 refresh
- Flutter plugin on pub.dev
- Rust SDK on crates.io

## Done in the last release

## How to influence the roadmap

- Open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/bithuman-product/bithuman-sdk-public/issues) with the `proposal` label
- Post in #roadmap-feedback in Discord
- Long-form proposals go through the [RFC process](/community/rfc-process)
