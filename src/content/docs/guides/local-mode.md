`bithuman-cli[local]` is an opt-in extra that swaps the cloud conversation
brain (OpenAI Realtime) for an **entirely in-process, on-device stack**
— whisper.cpp + llama.cpp + Supertonic + Silero VAD. No API key, no
outbound network, no separate servers. Same `bithuman run` command,
same browser URL, same avatar.

```bash
pip install 'bithuman-cli[local]'    # CLI sibling package; library is `bithuman`
bithuman pull modern-court-jester
BITHUMAN_LOCAL=1 bithuman run ~/.cache/bithuman/showcase/modern-court-jester.imx
# → open the printed http://127.0.0.1:8088/<CODE> URL in a browser
```

Shipped as the `[local]` extra on the CLI sibling wheel — `bithuman-cli`
as of 2.3.0 (previously `bithuman` itself, through 2.2.x). macOS arm64,
Linux x86_64, Linux aarch64; Python 3.10–3.14.

## When you'd reach for it

- **Privacy-bound deployments** — kiosks, healthcare, finance, classroom.
  Audio never leaves the device.
- **Offline / air-gapped** — demos at conferences with shaky WiFi, edge
  boxes in stores, field engineers.
- **Eliminate per-minute LLM/TTS spend** — pay once for the wheel,
  conversations are free thereafter.
- **Latency floor below network RTT** — when the speed of light to the
  nearest cloud region is itself the bottleneck.
- **Mobile portability ramp** — same C++ cores (whisper.cpp,
  llama.cpp, ONNX Runtime) have first-party iOS and Android builds. The
  exact `.gguf` / `.bin` / `.onnx` model files run on phones; the port
  is binding work, not re-architecture.

## The stack

| Slot | Backend (mobile-portable C++ core) | Default model | Disk | RAM |
| ---- | ---------------------------------- | ------------- | ---- | --- |
| STT  | `pywhispercpp` → whisper.cpp        | `tiny.en`     | 77 MB  | ~150 MB |
| LLM  | `llama-cpp-python` → llama.cpp      | Qwen 2.5 0.5B-Instruct Q4_K_M | 400 MB | ~600 MB |
| TTS  | `supertonic` → ONNX Runtime         | Supertonic 3 (31 languages, voice M1) | 380 MB | ~600 MB |
| VAD  | `livekit-plugins-silero`            | Silero        | 5 MB   | ~50 MB  |
| Avatar | `libessence`                       | `.imx`        | varies | ~300 MB |

**Total**: ~860 MB on disk for the brain + your avatar file; ~1.5 GB RAM
peak. First run downloads the brain models from HuggingFace into
`~/.cache/{huggingface,supertonic}` — about 90 seconds, once.

## Performance (M5 MacBook Pro)

| Stage | Latency (warm) |
| --- | --- |
| Pipeline warm load | **717 ms** (all four models from cache) |
| Whisper STT (4.6 s utterance, `tiny.en`) | **131 ms** |
| Qwen 2.5 0.5B (first token / 30-token reply at 96 tok/s) | **114 ms / 894 ms** |
| Supertonic TTS (10.7 s of speech, RTF 0.16) | **1,729 ms** |
| End-to-end (STT + LLM + TTS, sentence-blocking) | **2,754 ms** |
| First audible word (streamed token-by-token + sentence-chunked TTS) | **~800 ms** |

Cold start (every-model first download, first run only): ~90 s.
Process warm-up after that: under a second.

## Architecture

The local-mode brain is the same `livekit-agents` worker as the cloud
brain — only the `stt` / `llm` / `tts` plugins differ. The avatar
transport (`AvatarSession`), the embedded `livekit-server`, the browser
player, and the lifecycle are all unchanged.

```
bithuman run avatar.imx                  (Rust CLI, same as cloud)
├─ embedded livekit-server               (same)
├─ libessence avatar runtime             (same)
└─ bithuman.agent                        (Python livekit-agents worker)
   if BITHUMAN_LOCAL=1:                  (← the only branch)
     stt = WhisperSTT(...)
     llm = LlamaCppLLM(...)
     tts = SupertonicTTS(...)
     vad = silero.VAD.load()
   else:
     llm = openai.realtime.RealtimeModel(...)
```

The plugin classes live in the same namespace as the existing avatar
plugin — `livekit.plugins.bithuman.{WhisperSTT, LlamaCppLLM,
SupertonicTTS}` — so you can also use them in your own custom brain
without going through `bithuman run`. See
[Python SDK · LiveKit voice agents](/sdks/python#livekit-voice-agents)
for the pattern.

## Tuning

All optional. Defaults are tuned for "smallest models that produce
fluent English on a laptop CPU".

| Env var | Default | What |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `BITHUMAN_LOCAL` | _unset_ | `=1` flips the brain to the local stack. |
| `BITHUMAN_LOCAL_WHISPER` | `tiny.en` | whisper.cpp model size — `tiny.en` / `base.en` (multilingual: `tiny`, `base`, `small`, `medium`, `large-v3-turbo`). Larger = more accurate, more RAM, slower. |
| `BITHUMAN_LOCAL_LLM` | `Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-GGUF` | HuggingFace repo id of any GGUF chat LLM. |
| `BITHUMAN_LOCAL_LLM_FILE` | `qwen2.5-0.5b-instruct-q4_k_m.gguf` | GGUF file within the repo. |
| `BITHUMAN_LOCAL_VOICE` | `M1` | Supertonic preset (`M1`–`M5` male, `F1`–`F5` female). |
| `BITHUMAN_LOCAL_LANG` | `en` | Supertonic language. 31 supported: `en`, `ko`, `ja`, `es`, `de`, `fr`, `it`, `pt`, `ru`, `zh`, `hi`, `ar`, `nl`, `pl`, `tr`, `vi`, `id`, `th`, … |
| `BITHUMAN_INSTRUCTIONS` | short default | Override the system prompt. |

### Upgrading the LLM for quality

The 0.5B default keeps the entire stack under 1.5 GB RAM. For better
reasoning, swap to a bigger GGUF (any HuggingFace `*-GGUF` repo works):

```bash
# 1.7B (~1 GB on disk, ~1.5 GB RAM):
export BITHUMAN_LOCAL_LLM="Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct-GGUF"
export BITHUMAN_LOCAL_LLM_FILE="qwen2.5-1.5b-instruct-q4_k_m.gguf"

# Llama 3.2 3B (~2 GB on disk, ~3 GB RAM):
export BITHUMAN_LOCAL_LLM="bartowski/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct-GGUF"
export BITHUMAN_LOCAL_LLM_FILE="Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct-Q4_K_M.gguf"

BITHUMAN_LOCAL=1 bithuman run avatar.imx
```

### Multilingual setup

```bash
# Korean: bigger whisper + Korean Supertonic voice
export BITHUMAN_LOCAL_WHISPER=small        # multilingual
export BITHUMAN_LOCAL_LANG=ko
export BITHUMAN_LOCAL_VOICE=F1

BITHUMAN_LOCAL=1 bithuman run avatar.imx
```

The default LLM (Qwen 2.5) is multilingual; for production multilingual
deployments you might want to size it up too (1.5B+ recommended for
non-English fluency).

## Cloud vs local — side by side

| | **Cloud (default)** | **Local (`BITHUMAN_LOCAL=1`)** |
|---|---|---|
| Setup | `export OPENAI_API_KEY=...` | First run downloads ~860 MB once |
| Per-conversation cost | OpenAI Realtime pricing | $0 (one-time wheel install) |
| Network | OpenAI Realtime + LiveKit signal | LiveKit signal only (localhost) |
| Privacy | Audio + transcripts go to OpenAI | Audio stays on box |
| Languages | OpenAI-supported | 31 (Supertonic) for TTS; Whisper coverage for STT |
| RAM | ~300 MB (just the avatar) | ~1.5 GB |
| Latency floor | ~400-600 ms (network) | ~800 ms first-audio (compute-bound) |
| Mobile path | not applicable | iOS / Android via the same `.gguf` / `.bin` / `.onnx` |

Both modes use the **same Rust CLI**, the **same brain entrypoint**
(`bithuman.agent`), and the **same `AvatarSession`** plugin. One
env var is the only difference.

## Mobile portability — what's actually portable

The choice of all three backends was deliberately constrained to "has
official iOS + Android C++ builds, identical model files across
platforms":

| Backend | iOS | Android | Same model file? |
|---|---|---|---|
| whisper.cpp | ✅ official | ✅ official | ✅ same `.bin` |
| llama.cpp | ✅ official | ✅ official | ✅ same `.gguf` |
| ONNX Runtime (Supertonic) | ✅ ORT iOS | ✅ ORT Android | ✅ same `.onnx` |
| Silero VAD | ✅ pytorch-mobile / ONNX | ✅ same | ✅ same |

We picked these over alternatives that wouldn't port (Ollama is a
server, not a library; CTranslate2 has no iOS build; MLX is Apple-only).
The Python plugin layer is what ships today; the binding work to expose
them in Swift / Kotlin is the future port path, not a re-architecture.

## What's NOT in `bithuman-cli[local]`

- **Avatar generation** — you still need an `.imx` file. Generate one on
  [bithuman.ai](https://www.bithuman.ai/#explore) (free tier), or pull
  one from the showcase (`bithuman pull <slug>` → `~/.cache/bithuman/showcase/`).
- **Avatar metering** — `bithuman run` still pings `api.bithuman.ai`
  for credit accounting. Set `BITHUMAN_UNMETERED=1` for dev parity
  testing. Production deployments still need `BITHUMAN_API_KEY`.
- **Voice cloning** — Supertonic ships 10 voice presets. Custom voice
  cloning is a [hosted service](https://supertonic.supertone.ai/voice-builder)
  that produces JSON style files; once you have the JSON, inference is
  local but the cloning step is not.
- **Tool / function calling** — the default LLM (Qwen 2.5 0.5B) is too
  small to do reliable JSON tool calls. Swap to ≥3B for that.

## Troubleshooting

**Is local mode actually wired up?** Run `bithuman doctor` — it
verifies the `[local]` extras are importable and lists the resolved
backend versions.

**First run feels stuck.** It's downloading ~860 MB from HuggingFace.
Watch network activity; subsequent runs start in &lt;1 s.

**`BITHUMAN_LOCAL=1` errors with "required the local extras".** You
installed `bithuman-cli` without the `[local]` extra. Re-install:
`pip install 'bithuman-cli[local]'`.

**LLM is too dumb.** Bump to a bigger GGUF — see the table above.

**TTS pronouns wrong language.** Set `BITHUMAN_LOCAL_LANG` to match
your transcript language. Default `en`.

**Browser shows avatar but no audio.** Check the brain logs in the
terminal — there's structured tracing (`stt:transcribe duration_ms=…`,
`llm:first_token`, `tts:synthesize`). If `stt:transcribe` shows empty
text, your mic or VAD is the issue; if `llm:first_token` never fires,
the LLM model didn't load (probably the GGUF file name in
`BITHUMAN_LOCAL_LLM_FILE` is wrong).
