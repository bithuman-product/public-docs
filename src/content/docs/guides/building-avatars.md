An avatar is **likeness + voice + personality**. You supply some mix
of an image, a video, a voice clip, and a system prompt;
[bithuman.ai](https://www.bithuman.ai/#explore) packages the result
into an `.imx` file the runtime plays.

## Media uploads

| Input | Use for | Limits |
|---|---|---|
| **Image** | Facial likeness | < 10 MB, one person, front-facing, calm expression, well-lit |
| **Video** | Likeness + movement | < 30 s, one person, centered, stable, minimal motion |
| **Voice** | Voice cloning | < 1 min, clean (no music/noise), MP3 / WAV / M4A, natural speech |

### Priority rules

1. **Video > Image** — video always overwrites image for likeness.
2. **Image ⇒ auto-persona** — an image auto-generates a persona, so a
   manual prompt becomes optional.
3. **Voice** — when uploaded, replaces the auto-generated voice.
4. **Prompt** — required only when no image/video is provided.

| Combination | Result |
|---|---|
| Prompt only | Likeness + voice + movement from text — good for fictional characters |
| Image only | Instant avatar; persona + voice auto-generated |
| Image + Voice | Realistic recreation — image for face, voice for speech |
| Video + Voice + Prompt | Full control — video face, cloned voice, prompt personality |


Start simple: upload one good photo for an instant avatar, or write a
prompt for a creative character. Add voice or refine later.


Common fixes: poor lighting → edit before upload; background noise →
re-record in a quiet room; multiple people → crop to one;
excessive motion → keep it subtle.

## Prompts — the CO-STAR framework

Six fields cover everything that shapes response quality. Be specific
in every one — vague prompts produce vague avatars.

| Field | Defines | Weak → Strong |
|---|---|---|
| **C**ontext | Setting & situation | "customer service" → "Level-2 support for a cloud SaaS, handling escalated cases" |
| **O**bjective | The specific goal | "be helpful" → "resolve the issue in the first interaction" |
| **S**tyle | How they communicate | "be professional" → "like an Apple Genius Bar tech — uses analogies" |
| **T**one | Emotional attitude | patient, empathetic, calm under frustration |
| **A**udience | Who they talk to | "everyone" → "everyday users, beginner-to-intermediate" |
| **R**esponse | Output structure | "acknowledge → clarify → step-by-step → confirm → offer more" |

Template:

```text
CONTEXT:   [setting/situation the avatar operates in]
OBJECTIVE: [specific goal to achieve]
STYLE:     [how they communicate — which profession/persona]
TONE:      [emotional attitude]
AUDIENCE:  [who they're talking to — demographics]
RESPONSE:  [format/structure responses should follow]
```

Worked example (educational tutor):

```text
CONTEXT:   Online tutor helping high-schoolers with exam-season math.
           Students are stressed and need academic + emotional support.
OBJECTIVE: Explain concepts clearly, solve specific problems, build confidence.
STYLE:     Like an award-winning teacher — real-world examples, step-by-step.
TONE:      Encouraging, patient; reframe mistakes as learning.
AUDIENCE:  Ages 14–18, varying ability, some test anxiety.
RESPONSE:  Acknowledge → break into steps → encourage → analogy → confidence close.
```

Avoid: conflicting tones ("professional" + "casual and fun"), vague
objectives, "everyone" audiences, and skipping context.

## Animal mode

Upload a pet photo or use a pre-built animal character. The system
auto-detects the face (eye tracking, mouth, expression mapping). When
auto-detection fails, you'll be prompted to **Mark Face** — draw one
rectangle around eyes/nose/mouth/chin and submit; landmarks are
extracted from that box.

Best results: front-facing, high-contrast, well-lit, face filling the
frame. Side profiles produce unnatural movement — use straight-on
views. Start with a pre-built animal for guaranteed compatibility.

## The `.imx` file

The packaged output is a single `.imx` file — a self-contained
container with the avatar's frames, motion priors, voice config, and
metadata. The same file plays back on every runtime:
[Python](/sdks/python), [Swift](/sdks/swift), [Kotlin](/sdks/kotlin),
the [CLI](/getting-started/cli). Inspect one with `bithuman info
path/to/avatar.imx`.

## Curated showcase

Pre-built avatars are listed in the [showcase
manifest](https://www.bithuman.ai/#explore). From the CLI:

```bash
bithuman list                            # browse what's available
bithuman pull modern-court-jester        # cache to ~/.cache/bithuman/showcase/
bithuman run ~/.cache/bithuman/showcase/modern-court-jester.imx
```

## Programmatic creation

The same upload + packaging flow is available over HTTP — generate
agents from your own service without going through the website. See
the [REST API reference](/api-reference/overview) for the agent
generation endpoints (image / video / voice / prompt → `agent_code` →
deployable `.imx`).

## Pricing

What it costs to run an avatar after you've built it:

| Model | Use | Rate |
|---|---|---|
| Essence | Replay a packaged `.imx` | 1 credit / active minute |
| Expression | Generate face from an image at session start | 2 credits / active minute |

Audio-only sessions are 0 credits. Full breakdown in
[Pricing](/getting-started/pricing).
