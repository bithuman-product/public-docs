The `bithuman` plugin wraps the Swift and Kotlin SDKs under one Dart
API. Audio in, lip-synced video out at 25 FPS — fully on-device, with
per-platform echo cancellation auto-selected for you. One codebase
across **macOS, iOS, and Android**.


**Not on pub.dev yet, and the plugin source is not in a public repo.**
The plain `bithuman: ^X.Y.Z` snippet you may see in older docs will
fail `flutter pub get` with "package not found". The plugin and its
reference apps live in our private `bithuman-apps` repo, so external
developers can't clone them today. Two options:

- **Work with us directly** — reach out on
  [Discord](https://discord.gg/ES953n7bPA) for early access.
- **Build on the underlying SDKs** — use the
  [Swift SDK](/sdks/swift) on Apple platforms and the
  [Kotlin SDK](/sdks/kotlin) on Android via platform channels.

The pub.dev publish announcement will land in the
[changelog](https://docs.bithuman.ai/changelog) and on Discord.


Auth: provide your `BITHUMAN_API_SECRET` to the app (env var in
development, your own secret store in production). Get one at
[Developer → API Keys](https://www.bithuman.ai/#developer).

## Minimal usage

For teams with access, load an `.imx` model and host the avatar
canvas. The plugin owns the runtime, audio capture, lip-sync, and
echo cancellation.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:bithuman/bithuman.dart';

void main() {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  runApp(const MaterialApp(home: AvatarScreen()));
}

class AvatarScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  const AvatarScreen({super.key});
  @override
  State<AvatarScreen> createState() => _AvatarScreenState();
}

class _AvatarScreenState extends State<AvatarScreen> {
  BithumanAvatar? _avatar;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    WidgetsBinding.instance.addPostFrameCallback((_) async {
      // imxPath: an .imx downloaded from Explore, bundled or on disk.
      _avatar = await BithumanAvatar.load(imxPath);
      setState(() {});
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      body: _avatar == null
          ? const Center(child: CircularProgressIndicator())
          : AvatarCanvas(avatar: _avatar!),
    );
  }
}
```

Reference apps (settings, prompt hot-reload, full Essence pipeline on
all three platforms, OpenAI Realtime voice chat via
`package:bithuman/bithuman_realtime.dart`) live in the private
`bithuman-apps/flutter/` workspace. They aren't clone-able by external
users today; ping the team on Discord if you need a walkthrough.


The plugin covers the **Essence** cross-platform path today. For
**Expression** on Apple Silicon (Mac and iPad), pair it with the
native [Swift SDK](/sdks/swift).


## Requirements

| Platform | Floor |
|---|---|
| **macOS** | Apple Silicon M3+, macOS 26+ |
| **iOS / iPadOS** | iPhone 17 Pro+ or iPad Pro M4+, iOS 26+ |
| **Android** | `arm64-v8a`, Android 10+ |
| **Flutter** | 3.3+, Dart SDK 3.11+ |

Add the platform permission strings your app needs — microphone (all
platforms), plus `com.apple.security.device.audio-input` for sandboxed
macOS apps. The same iOS increased-memory entitlement the
[Swift SDK](/sdks/swift) requires applies here.

## Alternative: cloud-hosted via LiveKit

When the avatar should run on a server (shared between participants,
or Expression on a GPU) rather than on-device, the Flutter app becomes
a thin LiveKit subscriber and a Python agent runs the avatar. That's a
deployment shape, not this plugin — start from the runnable stacks:


  
    Essence on bitHuman cloud + LiveKit + web UI.
  
  
    A polished LiveKit video-chat front end to model yours on.
  


The Flutter client side is the standard
[`livekit_client`](https://pub.dev/packages/livekit_client) flow —
mint a room token from a server you control, subscribe to the agent's
video track. See [Deployment](/guides/deployment) for the full shape.

## Troubleshooting


  
    Confirm the `.imx` path resolves on-device and
    `BITHUMAN_API_SECRET` is reachable from the running app, then check
    the device meets the hardware floor above.
  
  
    Missing the increased-memory-limit entitlement — see the
    [Swift SDK](/sdks/swift) warning; it must be approved by Apple
    before it takes effect.
  
  
    `flutter clean && flutter pub get`, then rebuild. On iOS/macOS run
    `pod install` in the platform directory if pods are stale.
